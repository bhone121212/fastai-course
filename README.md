# Personal Implementations of Practical Deep Learning for Coders Problems

## Course Reference

Following on from the [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai) course and course material available on GitHub at [fastai/courses](https://github.com/fastai/courses).

## Repository Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to start from a blank point and reproduce experiments and problems presented in the course. This is to reinforce the learning and make my own mistakes while not just running and copying existing course code.
